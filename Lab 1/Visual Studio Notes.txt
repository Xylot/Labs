My files are stored under the visual studio 2015 folder in my documents

I created one solution housing each of the four sub-projects

The folders created are:
	Babylonian
	Gravity
	ProgressiveTaxes
	Divison
	Debug

The immediate files present are:
	solution file
	vc++ project (filters) file
	
	

Each folder contains its own source file, vc++ project file, vc++ project filters file and debug folder

Within the debug folder lies the application, the log, dependancy file, debug database, obj file, and tlog folder
